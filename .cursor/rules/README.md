# Cursor AI Rules Framework for PCPartKeeper React

## 🎯 Overview

This framework implements the [Cursor AI Rules Framework](https://github.com/xLUPOx/cursor-ai-rules-framework/) specifically tailored for your PCPartKeeper React project. It transforms AI agents from simple command executors to **Autonomous Principal Engineers** through rigorous workflow enforcement and evidence-based decision making.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Framework is Already Installed

The framework is already set up in your project. The AI agent will automatically use these rules when working on your PCPartKeeper React project.

### 2. Using the Playbooks

Copy and paste these playbooks into chat to initiate specific workflows:

#### Standard Development Tasks

```
Copy the entire content of .cursor/rules/playbooks/request.md
Replace [YOUR_GOAL] with your specific objective
Paste into chat
```

#### Root Cause Analysis

```
Copy the entire content of .cursor/rules/playbooks/refresh.md
Replace [DESCRIBE THE PERSISTENT ISSUE] with your problem
Paste into chat
```

#### Session Retrospective

```
Copy the entire content of .cursor/rules/playbooks/retro.md
Paste into chat at the end of a session
```

## 🎯 Operational Phases

The framework enforces a systematic 5-phase approach:

### Phase 0: Reconnaissance

- **NEVER** act on assumption
- **ALWAYS** research first
- Understand current state, requirements, and constraints
- Identify risks and dependencies

### Phase 1: Planning

- Define clear objectives and success criteria
- Break tasks into manageable components
- Map dependencies and critical path
- Plan risk mitigation strategies

### Phase 2: Execution

- Make small, verifiable changes
- Test and validate each step
- Document decisions and evidence
- Handle errors gracefully

### Phase 3: Testing

- Comprehensive testing at all levels
- Unit, integration, and system testing
- Performance and accessibility validation
- User acceptance testing

### Phase 4: Documentation

- Complete code documentation
- API and user documentation
- Architecture and decision records
- Change documentation

### Phase 5: Self-Audit

- Mandatory self-assessment
- Process effectiveness evaluation
- Learning capture and synthesis
- Framework improvement recommendations

## 🔧 React-Specific Guidelines

The framework includes specialized rules for React development:

- **Component Architecture**: Functional components with hooks
- **State Management**: Appropriate patterns for different use cases
- **Performance Optimization**: React.memo, useMemo, useCallback
- **Testing Standards**: Comprehensive component testing
- **Styling Guidelines**: Tailwind CSS best practices
- **Error Handling**: Error boundaries and graceful degradation
- **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation

## 📊 Status Markers

The framework uses clear status indicators:

- `✅` - Objective completed successfully
- `⚠️` - Recoverable issue encountered and fixed autonomously
- `🚧` - Blocked; awaiting input or resource
- `🔄` - In progress; work continuing
- `❌` - Failed; requires intervention

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Technical Excellence

- All code is tested and documented
- No regressions introduced
- Performance maintained or improved
- Architecture is clean and maintainable

### Process Excellence

- All phases completed systematically
- Evidence collected for all decisions
- Risks identified and mitigated
- Continuous improvement demonstrated

### Communication Excellence

- Clear status reporting
- Transparent decision-making
- Complete documentation
- Actionable recommendations

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

The framework includes built-in self-improvement protocols:

- **Session Reflection**: Mandatory retrospective analysis
- **Learning Capture**: Knowledge synthesis and application
- **Process Optimization**: Workflow improvements based on experience
- **Framework Evolution**: Continuous enhancement of rules and protocols

## 📋 Usage Examples

### Starting a New Feature

1. Use the `request.md` playbook
2. Replace `[YOUR_GOAL]` with your feature description
3. The AI will follow the 5-phase approach automatically

### Debugging Persistent Issues

1. Use the `refresh.md` playbook
2. Describe the persistent problem
3. The AI will conduct root cause analysis

### Session Wrap-up

1. Use the `retro.md` playbook
2. The AI will analyze the session and suggest improvements

## 🛠️ Customization

The framework is designed to be customized for your specific needs:

- **Feature-Specific Guidelines**: Use `guidelines-template.md` to create feature-specific rules
- **Project Templates**: Use `feature-template.md` for consistent development processes
- **Extension Rules**: Add domain-specific rules in the `extensions/` directory
