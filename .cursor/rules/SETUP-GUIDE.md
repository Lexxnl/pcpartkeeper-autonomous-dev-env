- `üîÑ` - In progress; work continuing
- `‚ùå` - Failed; requires intervention

## üéØ Next Steps

### 1. Try the Framework

Start with a simple task to see the framework in action:

```
Copy: .cursor/rules/playbooks/request.md
Replace: [YOUR_GOAL] with "Add a simple component to display PC parts"
Paste into chat
```

### 2. Explore the Rules

Review the framework files to understand the approach:

- **`.cursor/rules/GLOBAL-RULES.mdc`** - Core principles and protocols
- **`.cursor/rules/extensions/react-development.md`** - React-specific guidelines
- **`.cursor/rules/docs/feature-template.md`** - Feature development checklist

### 3. Customize for Your Needs

The framework is designed to be customized:

- Add feature-specific guidelines using `guidelines-template.md`
- Create project-specific templates
- Modify rules to fit your development style

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Framework Not Working?

- Ensure files are in the correct `.cursor/rules/` directory
- Check that Cursor is using the rules (restart Cursor if needed)
- Verify the playbook content is copied completely

### Need Help?

- Review the framework documentation in `.cursor/rules/README.md`
- Check the original framework repository: https://github.com/xLUPOx/cursor-ai-rules-framework/
- Use the `retro.md` playbook to analyze any issues

## üéâ You're Ready!

The Cursor AI Rules Framework is now active in your PCPartKeeper React project. Every development session will follow senior engineering best practices with systematic research, planning, execution, testing, and continuous improvement.
