# Execution Phase Protocols

## üöÄ Phase 2: Execution (VERIFIED)

### Incremental Progress

**Small, verifiable changes**

**Protocol:**

1. **Atomic Changes** - Each change should be complete and testable
2. **Incremental Validation** - Verify each change before proceeding
3. **Rollback Capability** - Each change should be reversible
4. **Progress Tracking** - Document what was changed and why
5. **Quality Gates** - Meet quality standards at each step

**Standards:**

- Changes should be small enough to understand completely
- Each change should have a clear purpose
- Changes should be independently testable
- Progress should be measurable and verifiable

### Continuous Validation

**Test and verify each step**

**Protocol:**

1. **Pre-Change Testing** - Verify current state before changes
2. **Post-Change Testing** - Verify changes work as expected
3. **Regression Testing** - Ensure existing functionality still works
4. **Integration Testing** - Verify changes work with other components
5. **Performance Testing** - Ensure changes don't degrade performance

**Testing Levels:**

- **Unit Tests** - Individual component testing
- **Integration Tests** - Component interaction testing
- **System Tests** - End-to-end functionality testing
- **Performance Tests** - Speed and resource usage testing
- **User Acceptance Tests** - User experience validation

### Evidence Collection

**Document decisions and outcomes**

**Protocol:**

1. **Decision Documentation** - Record why decisions were made
2. **Change Documentation** - What was changed and why
3. **Test Results** - Document test outcomes and evidence
4. **Performance Metrics** - Record performance characteristics
5. **Issue Tracking** - Document problems and resolutions

**Evidence Types:**

- **Code Changes** - Git commits with clear messages
- **Test Results** - Pass/fail status and metrics
- **Performance Data** - Speed, memory, resource usage
- **User Feedback** - Screenshots, user experience notes
- **Architecture Decisions** - Design choices and rationale

### Error Handling

**Graceful failure with recovery strategies**

**Protocol:**

1. **Error Detection** - Identify errors quickly and accurately
2. **Error Analysis** - Understand root cause and impact
3. **Recovery Planning** - Determine best recovery strategy
4. **Recovery Execution** - Implement recovery with minimal impact
5. **Learning Capture** - Document lessons learned from errors

**Error Categories:**

- **Syntax Errors** - Code compilation issues
- **Runtime Errors** - Execution-time failures
- **Logic Errors** - Incorrect program behavior
- **Integration Errors** - Component interaction failures
- **Performance Errors** - Speed or resource issues

### Progress Reporting

**Regular status updates with evidence**

**Protocol:**

1. **Status Updates** - Regular progress reports
2. **Evidence Presentation** - Show proof of progress
3. **Issue Reporting** - Transparent problem communication
4. **Decision Communication** - Explain choices and rationale
5. **Next Steps** - Clear indication of what's coming next

**Report Format:**

```
