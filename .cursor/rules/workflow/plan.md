# Planning Phase Protocols

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 1: Planning (STRUCTURED)

### Objective Definition

**Clear, measurable goals with success criteria**

**Protocol:**

1. **Goal Clarity** - Define what success looks like
2. **Success Metrics** - How will we measure completion?
3. **Scope Boundaries** - What's included/excluded?
4. **Timeline Expectations** - When should this be complete?
5. **Quality Standards** - What level of quality is required?

**Deliverables:**

- Clear objective statement
- Measurable success criteria
- Defined scope boundaries
- Realistic timeline
- Quality requirements

### Task Decomposition

**Break complex tasks into manageable components**

**Protocol:**

1. **High-Level Breakdown** - Major phases or components
2. **Detailed Tasks** - Specific, actionable items
3. **Dependencies** - What must be done before what?
4. **Effort Estimation** - Time/complexity for each task
5. **Priority Ranking** - Critical path identification

**Structure:**

```
## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: [Phase Name]
- [ ] Task 1.1: [Description] (Estimated: [time])
  - Dependencies: [list]
  - Success criteria: [criteria]
- [ ] Task 1.2: [Description] (Estimated: [time])
  - Dependencies: [list]
  - Success criteria: [criteria]

### Phase 2: [Phase Name]
- [ ] Task 2.1: [Description] (Estimated: [time])
  - Dependencies: [list]
  - Success criteria: [criteria]
```

### Dependency Mapping

**Identify prerequisites and execution order**

**Protocol:**

1. **Prerequisite Analysis** - What must exist first?
2. **Resource Dependencies** - What tools/data are needed?
3. **Technical Dependencies** - What code/components are required?
4. **External Dependencies** - What external factors affect this?
5. **Critical Path** - What's the longest dependency chain?

**Deliverables:**

- Dependency graph or list
- Critical path identification
- Resource requirements
- Risk points in dependency chain

### Risk Mitigation

**Plan for potential issues and fallback strategies**

**Protocol:**

1. **Risk Identification** - What could go wrong?
2. **Impact Assessment** - How bad would it be?
3. **Probability Estimation** - How likely is it?
4. **Mitigation Strategies** - How do we prevent it?
5. **Contingency Plans** - What do we do if it happens?

**Risk Categories:**

- **Technical Risks** - Code complexity, integration issues
- **Resource Risks** - Time, tools, data availability
- **External Risks** - API changes, third-party dependencies
- **User Impact Risks** - Breaking existing functionality

### Resource Allocation

**Assign tools, time, and effort appropriately**

**Protocol:**

1. **Tool Selection** - Which tools are best for each task?
2. **Time Allocation** - How much time for each phase?
3. **Effort Distribution** - Where to focus energy?
4. **Parallel Opportunities** - What can be done simultaneously?
5. **Buffer Planning** - Extra time for unexpected issues

**Resource Types:**

- **Development Tools** - IDEs, frameworks, libraries
- **Testing Tools** - Unit tests, integration tests, manual testing
- **Documentation Tools** - Markdown, diagrams, screenshots
- **Time Resources** - Development time, testing time, review time

## ðŸ“‹ Planning Checklist

### Pre-Planning

- [ ] Objective is clearly defined
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Scope boundaries are established
- [ ] Timeline is realistic
- [ ] Quality standards are defined

### During Planning

- [ ] Tasks are broken down appropriately
- [ ] Dependencies are identified and mapped
- [ ] Risks are assessed and mitigation planned
- [ ] Resources are allocated effectively
- [ ] Critical path is identified

### Post-Planning

- [ ] Plan is reviewed for completeness
