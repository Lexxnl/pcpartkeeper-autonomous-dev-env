**OPERATIONAL PROTOCOL INITIATED**

## Phase 0: Reconnaissance

**Research-first approach - understanding before action**

I will now analyze the current state of the PCPartKeeper React project to understand:

- Current codebase structure and architecture
- Existing dependencies and technologies
- Project requirements and constraints
- Available resources and tools
- Potential risks and dependencies

**Objective**: [YOUR_GOAL]

**Context Analysis Required:**

- [ ] Project structure and architecture
- [ ] Technology stack and dependencies
- [ ] Current functionality and features
- [ ] User requirements and constraints
- [ ] Performance and quality standards

**Evidence Collection:**

- [ ] Codebase analysis report
- [ ] Dependency mapping
- [ ] Risk assessment
- [ ] Resource inventory
- [ ] Requirements documentation

## Phase 1: Planning

**Structured planning with clear objectives**

Based on reconnaissance findings, I will create a comprehensive plan including:

- Clear task breakdown with dependencies
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Resource allocation and timeline
- Quality standards and success criteria
- Testing and validation approach

**Planning Deliverables:**

- [ ] Structured task breakdown
- [ ] Dependency mapping
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies
- [ ] Resource allocation plan
- [ ] Success criteria definition

## Phase 2: Execution

**Incremental progress with continuous validation**

I will execute the plan with:

- Small, verifiable changes
- Continuous testing and validation
- Evidence collection for all decisions
- Error handling and recovery strategies
- Regular progress reporting

**Execution Standards:**

- [ ] Atomic, testable changes
- [ ] Continuous validation
- [ ] Evidence documentation
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Progress reporting

## Phase 3: Testing

**Comprehensive testing at all levels**

I will ensure quality through:

- Unit testing for all new code
- Integration testing for component interactions
- System testing for end-to-end functionality
- Performance testing for optimization
- User acceptance testing for experience

**Testing Requirements:**

- [ ] Unit test coverage
- [ ] Integration test validation
- [ ] System test completion
- [ ] Performance verification
- [ ] User experience validation

## Phase 4: Documentation

**Complete documentation for maintainability**

I will document:

- Code changes with clear comments
- API updates and usage examples
- User-facing changes with guides
- Architectural decisions and rationale
- Testing procedures and results

**Documentation Standards:**

- [ ] Code documentation
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] User documentation
- [ ] Architecture documentation
- [ ] Change documentation

## Phase 5: Self-Audit

**Mandatory self-assessment and improvement**

I will perform a complete audit:

- Objective completion assessment
- Process effectiveness evaluation
- Quality metrics analysis
- Learning capture and synthesis
- Framework improvement recommendations

**Audit Deliverables:**

- [ ] Objective completion report
- [ ] Process effectiveness analysis
- [ ] Quality metrics summary
- [ ] Learning capture document
- [ ] Framework improvement proposals

**STATUS**: ðŸ”„ **INITIATING RECONNAISSANCE PHASE**

I will now begin the systematic analysis of your PCPartKeeper React project to understand the current state and requirements for achieving [YOUR_GOAL].

**Next Steps:**

1. Analyze current project structure
2. Review existing code and dependencies
3. Identify requirements and constraints
4. Assess risks and opportunities
5. Create comprehensive implementation plan

Please confirm this approach and provide any additional context or specific requirements for [YOUR_GOAL].
