# ADR-0001: Record Architecture Decisions

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Deciders:** Development Team

## Context

We need to document the architectural decisions made in this project to provide context for future development and onboarding of new team members.

## Decision

Use Architecture Decision Records (ADR) as described by Michael Nygard in his article [Documenting architecture decisions](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

We will keep ADRs in `docs/adr/` directory, numbered sequentially and with descriptive names.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Decisions are documented and searchable
- New team members can understand context
- Easy to review past decisions
- Helps prevent re-litigating settled decisions

### Negative
- Requires discipline to write ADRs
- May slow down fast iteration on architectural changes
- Could become outdated if not maintained

## Notes
- Each ADR should be focused on a single architectural decision
- Keep ADRs concise but include enough context
- Update ADRs when decisions change
- Number ADRs sequentially for easy reference
