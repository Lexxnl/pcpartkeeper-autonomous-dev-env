# ADR-0002: Use Zustand for State Management

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Deciders:** Development Team

## Context

We needed a state management solution for the React application that could handle:
- Global application state (items, filters, UI state)
- Complex state logic with derived values
- Persistence of user preferences
- Good TypeScript support
- Minimal boilerplate

Options considered:
- **Redux**: Industry standard, but too complex for our needs with significant boilerplate
- **Context API**: Native to React, but performance concerns with frequent updates
- **Zustand**: Lightweight library with minimal boilerplate and excellent TypeScript support
- **Jotai**: Atomic state management, good but less mature ecosystem

## Decision

Use Zustand for global state management.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Simple API, easy to learn and use
- Excellent TypeScript support out of the box
- Small bundle size impact (~1.5KB)
- No boilerplate compared to Redux
- Built-in support for middleware (devtools, persist)
- Good performance with selective subscriptions
- Easy to test
- Flexible store structure with slices

### Negative
- Smaller ecosystem and community compared to Redux
- Less online resources and tutorials available
- May need migration to Redux if application grows significantly

## Implementation

Current store structure:
```typescript
// Separate stores for different concerns
const useItemsStore = create<ItemsState>((set) => ({
  items: [],
  filters: {},
  // ... actions
}));

const useUIStore = create<UIState>((set) => ({
  selectedItems: [],
  // ... actions
}));
```

## Notes
- If application grows to >10,000 items or complex nested state, consider migrating to Redux
- Current implementation uses separate stores per domain (items, UI, user)
- Store subscriptions are optimized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Consider adding persistence middleware for user preferences in the future
